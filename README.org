AudioSource wrapper with Async operation in mind.

** Problem of AudioSource with async/await

*** Stopping on cancellation could stops other clip unintentionally

Assume that you have a function that play audioClip asynchronously:

#+begin_src csharp
AudioSource as;

public async UniTask PlayTutorial(CancellationToken csncellationToken)
{
    try
    {
        as.clip = yourClip;
        as.Play();
        // awaits as you want e.g. till the end of the clip
    } catch (OperationCanceledException)
    {
        as.Stop();
    }
}
#+end_src

As it is async function, it should handles cancellation. 
you might write:

#+begin_src csharp
AudioSource as;

public async UniTask PlayTutorial(CancellationToken csncellationToken)
{
    try
    {
        as.clip = yourClip;
        as.Play();
        // awaits as you want e.g. till the end of the clip
    } catch (OperationCanceledException)
    {
        as.Stop();
    }
}
#+end_src
